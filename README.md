# BookCatalog
Simple library project in Kotlin that tests basics and database integration with DatabaseHelper with SQLLite!

There is a CDPlayer code that wouldn't function because I didn't include the song in the files, you can add a specific song under the name lofi.mp3 by following the tree path BookCatalog\app\src\main\res\raw


Sorry for the lack of documentation on this one! I was pressed on time, thanks for viewing it!
